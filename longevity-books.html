 <h3> 100 Plus: How the Coming Age of Longevity Will Change Everything </h3>
 <p> Sonia Arrison <br> 2011 </p>
 <p> What will your life look like when you live to be over 100? Will you be healthy? Will your marriage need a sunset clause? How long will you have to work? Will you finish one career at sixty-five only to go back to school to learn a new one? And then, will you be happily working for another sixty years? Maybe you’ll be a parent to a newborn and a grandparent at the same time. Will the world become overpopulated? </p>

 <h3> A Brief Eternity: The Philosophy of Longevity </h3>
 <p> Pascal Bruckner  <br> 2021 </p>
 <p> There is one fundamental thing that has changed in our societies since 1950: life has got longer. Over the last few generations, 20 or 30 years have been added to the duration of our lives. But after the age of 50, human beings experience a kind of suspension: no longer young, not really old, they are, as it were, weightless.  </p>

 <h3> Systemic Delivery Technologies in Anti-Aging Medicine: Methods and Applications </h3>
 <p> Dr. Wing-Fu Lai <br> 2020 </p>
 <p> This book presents a multidisciplinary assessment of the state of science in the use of systemic delivery technologies to deliver anti-aging therapeutics now under development. There is a gap between basic aging research and the development of intervention technologies. This major obstacle must be overcome before biogerontological interventions can be put into clinical practice. As biogerontology comes to understand aging as a systemic degenerative process, it is clear that there is a pressing need for technologies that enable cells and tissues in a fully developed adult body to be manipulated systemically to combat aging. The authors review advances in the chemistry and engineering of systemic delivery methods and analyze the strengths and limitations of each. </p>
